# A Netflix clone React app  created with Stripe Checkout & Webhooks, Redux, Firestore, and Google Auth. This app integrates Stripe Checkout to provide an easy and secure way for customers to make payments, as well as Webhooks for quick updates about new subscription payments. The Redux library provides a functional way to create a single store for all application state and make sure there's a single source of truth. Firestore powers the backend, providing real-time updates and syncing data across devices while the Google Auth library authenticates users. With this setup, users can quickly and securely access and enjoy a Netflix-style experience!
